# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project was built as a demonstration of building an app using React, Vite, Material UI, TypeScript, SOLID principles, and a mock server as the backend. The focus was on making the application modular by separating each field into its respective file. If a new company is added to the database, it should work seamlessly with the current setup, provided the field types remain consistent with those mapped in this test.

The styling of this application is basic, as it was not the primary focus.

## Running the Application

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
